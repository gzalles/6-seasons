# 6 Seasons

A simple instrument in MAX and Pd to compose music with hydrophone recordings using ambisonics. For in-depth info see [this doc](pdf/6seasons_TENOR23.pdf).

## Requirements

The Pd version relies on iem_ambi package. We use the NK2 hardware by Korg. The MAX version uses Spat5.

## Installation

See README inside each version. Please contact if you wish to use this instrument, we'd be happy to help you set it up.
