#X text 13 6 what are dependencies?;
#X text 13 37 these are libraries/hardware that are required for the
patch to work. in order to install these libraries go to Help > Find
Externals and type in the name of the 5 libraries: zexy \, iem_ambi
\, vbap \, iem_matrix and iem_lib. the final dependency is the Korg
NK2 MIDI controller. you may find it on ebay.;
#X text 13 169 the patch is meant to be controlled almost exclusively
with the controller NK2 \, most of the functions of the patch do not
work unless you use the controller. we will try to work on that in
the future. the only part of the patch that must be controlled with
a mouse is the "player gains" which set the ADC~ volumes for inputs
1-4.;
#X text 13 138 other notes;
#X text 14 279 the start PD~ toggle initializes 8 sub-processes so
behind the scenes we actually have many instances of Pd running at
the same time \, allowing us to make use of multiple CPUs on the computer.
there are also other sub-processes for VBAP spatialization of live
inputs and recording.;

#X text 11 5 use smaller files caf? flac? next?;
#X text 88 31 pd vanilla does not like compressed audio files \, there
are a few externals that are in development around the internet but
i decided to not try that since i am not sure how long they will be
supported. Since the files are read from disk it does not improve performance
but the audio files can take a lot of memory \, they are about 6.5GB.

#X text 10 132 is there any way to "package" the app? using libpd?
maybe as a JUCE app?;
